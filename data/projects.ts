    description: `I built AssetsAI when exploring Stable Diffusion back in 2022. The scene was rising with people rolling out projects every other day using Stable Diffusion and Dreambooth. \n\nAfter getting my hands on it for a while, I came up with this idea to create a marketplace for purchasing AI generated game assets. I found out that the game dev community didn't have anything in particular to generate game assets. \n\nWith this project, I had created a platform of over 300+ curated game assets from 10+ categories so that game developers can utilise these and make their development cycle shorter, or take inspiration from these and help their building process.       
    Even though I wasn't able to get any sales, mostly due to me not marketing it in the relevant platforms and channels, It has around 150 weekly active users still.`,

All humans perceive colors differently, and some folks with problems like color blindness have difficulty detecting some colors as well. \n\nThe candidate WCAG 3 algorithm for color contrast, APCA. Accessible Perceptual Contrast Algorithm (APCA) is a contrast assessment method for predicting the perceived contrast between sRGB colors on a computer monitor. It has been developed as an assessment method for W3 Silver/WCAG3 accessibility standards relating to content for computer displays and mobile devices, with a focus on readability and understandability. It is based on human perception of colors and backwards compatible with WCAG 2.1`,
